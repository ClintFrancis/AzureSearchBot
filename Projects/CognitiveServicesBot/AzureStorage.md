# Storage
## Blob Storage
Navigate to the Azure portal and create a new Storage account.

##### Create a new Container
Create a new container named _images_ and set its public access level to _Blob_

##### Upload the images

We're going to use the Storage Explorer to upload our image assets to the newly created Storage Container.
 If you donâ€™t have the Storage Explorer app yet, download it from [storageexplorer.com](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer/).
 
After authenticating with the Storage Explorer you'll be able to browse to the target container in the new Storage account.

Upload all the images in the `Resources\images` folder to the target container, then head back to the Azure portal to verify them.

##### Get the Container URL

Now we need to make a note of the Storage Container's URL. Click on _Properties_ and copy the URL to your clipboard - paste it somewhere easy to get hold of for now.
